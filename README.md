There is a need for improved functionality.

①　The choices of the questionnaire questions are not precise enough, such as multiple selection and lace of restrictions, such as three choices at most.

②　The overall UI is not pretty enough.

③　UI design does not automatically adapt to use devices.

④　In the app on the client side, there is no function to generate the questionnaire, and the QR code of the questionnaire needs to be generated by the server side.

⑤　Missing the ability to return to the previous question, such as a wrong selection of the previous question, there is no way to return to the re-selection, therefore, 
missing the ability to return to the previous question.

⑥　The app also lacks third-party login functions, such as qq login and so on.

⑦　The app should also be available in landscape.

⑧　Lack of visual function of questionnaire answer report.

⑨　The app can only be used in Android system, and the cross-platform is not too high, so this aspect also needs to be improved.

⑩　The app is stable at run time, but not robust enough.

⑪　The app lacks the function of friends, and it cannot share the questionnaires that others have made to other users, which is not easy to use.
